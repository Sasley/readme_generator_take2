# Readme_generator

## Professional README Generator

The README.md file can be challenging for new students and tidius for developers. This project helps coders no matter their level to produce a professional README file. I learned how to use node to utilize npm files to produce an end project.

## Installation

In order to install my project you will need to download my github repository. Also, have node installed on your computer. 

## Usage

Open the integrated terminal from the (index.js) file. Type the phrase "node index.js" in the command line. Next a series of questions will populate. Your answers will be populated together in a file called "README". This is your generated README file (located in utils/README.md). Enjoy! If you have any problems please report them to me @https://github.com/Sasley .
